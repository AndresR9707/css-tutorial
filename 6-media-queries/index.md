# Media Queries

* [Let's see](https://mediaqueri.es/)
* The CSS Media Query gives you a way to apply CSS only when the browser and device environment matches a rule that you specify, for example "viewport is wider than 480 pixels".

* Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse.

### Syntax:

```css
@media media-type and (media-feature-rule) {
  /* CSS rules go here */
}
```

* Media type, which tells the browser what kind of media this code is for (e.g. print, or screen).
* The media expression, which is a rule, or test that must be passed for the contained CSS to be applied.
* The set of CSS rules that will be applied if the test passes and the media type is correct.
